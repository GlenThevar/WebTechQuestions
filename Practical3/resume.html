              Hive is a blockchain based social media, it is a project that I
              decided to work upon in order to get a better understanding of how
              blockchain works. This project is a still a work in progress and I
              keep on iterating on it whenever I get the time to. As of now,
              Hive is operating on the sepolia test nestnet.

              Technology Used: <br />
              1. Thirdweb - Allows users to build Dapps by abstracting most of
              the complexity.
              <br />
              2. React, Tailwind and Daisy UI - Used to build the frontend of
              the application
              <br />
              3. Pinata, IPFS - To store the images on the IPFS network.

              On the 24th of December, I eagerly signed up for a college event
              called "XPLORE," where all participants were tasked with creating
              their own projects. Feeling adventurous, I decided to dive into
              the realm of Machine Learning and develop a Sign language
              detection model, even though I had no previous experience in this
              field. 
              <br><br>
              I realize it might sound like a crazy idea, but I firmly
              believe that the best way to learn anything is by getting hands-on
              and working on practical projects. Over the following two months,
              I committed myself to a process of research and development. I
              began by constructing a database using OpenCV, comprising 1200
              images for each hand sign, which I divided into 600 for training
              and 600 for testing purposes. I then delved into the intricacies
              of the CNN algorithm, learning its principles and implementing it
              effectively. Through my dedicated efforts, I successfully created
              a model that achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 80.73%.
              <br><br>Additionally, I utilised the EEL library in Python to construct a
              user-friendly graphical interface for the application. Even though
              I didn't emerge as the winner of the competition, engaging in a
              project that was completely new to me allowed me to acquire
              valuable knowledge and skills.
